## Status
In development, but the release (v1.0.0) is stable.

## What does it do?
I'm just putting key data and a few dev tools into an admin widget.

Right now, the only tool is a button to toggle Debugging. Your options are off or everything.

## To Do
- [ ] Better test release
- [ ] Add site lockdown button
      With 1 click, reset all passwords and email addresses so no one can log in. Not yours of course and all of the data is saved for a 1 click restore.
- [ ] Add plugin monitors
      There are a lot of great dev tools that shouldn't be left running on production sites. This would monitor those and give you a button to deactivate them.
- [ ] Does Debugging need options?
